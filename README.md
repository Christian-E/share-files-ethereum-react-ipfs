# share-files-ethereum-react-ipfs
I made this small project because I wanted to get a better understanding of the ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. It is purely for educational purposes.

The project consists of a smart contract (for the ethereum blockchain) and a tiny react frontend that uses web3.js to interact with the smart contract.
Furthermore IPFS is used for storing data.
